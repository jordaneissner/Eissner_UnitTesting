# Uses the separated cloud type and precipitation data frames to answer the questions: Do entrainment
# rates vary across different convective regimes? Do entrianment rates vary based on precipitation? 
# A student's t-test is used to answer these questions

# ARGS
# cloud:     data frame containing all cloud properties of each regime
# 
#
# OUTPUT 
# ttest:      the p-squared values of the t-test
