# Imports a file of all of the clouds identified and their properties and turns it
# into a variable data frame. It then classifies each cloud
# into either shallow cumulus (CTH: 0-4km) or congestus (CTH: 5-9km) and saves the properties
# in separate files. 
#
# ARGS
# file:     file being used (contains all of the clouds and properties)
# data:     data frame of the data
#
# OUTPUT - two data frames, each containing all of the cloud properties of each regime
# shallow - ER, CTH, CBH, thickness, RH
# congestus - ER, CTH, CBH, thickness, RH
