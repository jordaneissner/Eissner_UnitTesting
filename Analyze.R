# Uses the separated cloud type and precipitation data frames to analyze dependencies,
# correlations, and significances. This is done by making plots of ER vs RH for all regimes
# and ER vs thickness for all regimes and calculating R^2. 
#
# ARGS
# cloud:     data frame containing all cloud properties of each regime
# 
#
# OUTPUT 
# The R^2 values of entrainment correlations with each predicted dependency for each regime.
# If all regimes are run, there should be a total of 8 values outputted.
